# Informational Crypto Program

##  A python program that uses CoinMarketCap API to determine and display data about a myriad of cryptocurrencies.

This project emplyos CoinMarketCap web API to access JSON data about the cryptocurrency market. It then gives the user the option to search a cryptocurrency by name and see various statistics about that cryptocurrency, or see the highest and lowest daily change and three monthly change of the entire crypto market.

Example Run: The program is run, and extracts the json data from the web API. The user is then asked what they would like to determine. In this example, the user will enter "Bitcoin" to determine facts about Bitcoin:

The program then outputs various facts about the cryptocurrency to the user using the JSON data, and gives the user the option to continue the program.

## Lessons Learned: 

  - This project was created in my first computer science college course, Intro to Computing. It was my first experience with Python.
  - This was also my first time working with web API's and JSON data. JSON was tough to figure out at first, but not too bad once I learned how to access certain data.
  - This was my first introduction to classes and methods. I have grown a long way from this program, and have noticed a lot that I can implement to improve the program.

## The Future!

Looking back on this project, there are many ways I can further develop the program. Now that I am learning OOP, I definitely want to create more methods, such as a bubble sort method, instead of calling bubble sort within each individual method. At some point I would also like to add a visual element to it, once I learn a visual Python interface. I think it would be interesting to compare different cryptocurrencies values over time.
