# Cryptocurrency Information Program

## Overview

This Python program leverages the CoinMarketCap API to provide comprehensive data on a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Users can search for specific cryptocurrencies by name to view detailed statistics or analyze the market’s highest and lowest daily and three-month changes.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Access**: Connects to the CoinMarketCap API to retrieve live cryptocurrency data.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to look up specific cryptocurrencies by name and view detailed statistics.
- **Market Analysis**: Provides an overview of market trends, including the highest and lowest daily changes and three-month performance changes.

## Example Usage

When the program is executed, it pulls data from the CoinMarketCap API. Users are prompted to enter the name of a cryptocurrency they wish to view. For example, if a user enters “Bitcoin,” the program retrieves and displays various statistics on Bitcoin:

The program then presents relevant information on the cryptocurrency and gives the user the option to continue exploring other cryptocurrencies.

## Lessons Learned

- **Python Fundamentals**: This project was my first experience with Python, created during my *Intro to Computing* course.
- **Working with APIs**: I learned how to interact with web APIs and work with JSON data. While JSON formatting initially posed challenges, I quickly gained familiarity with accessing specific data elements.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: This project introduced me to classes and methods, building a foundation for further development in software engineering. Reflecting on this experience, I see many areas for improvement and refinement in the program.

## Future Enhancements

Reflecting on this project, I see several ways to enhance and expand its capabilities:

- **Refactor with OOP Principles**: As I advance in OOP concepts, I plan to separate specific functions into distinct methods. For instance, instead of embedding a bubble sort directly in multiple places, I could create a standalone sorting method.
- **Add Visual Elements**: Once I gain experience with graphical interfaces in Python, I aim to add a visual component. This could allow users to graph cryptocurrency trends and compare values over time, enhancing the user experience and overall data interactivity.
